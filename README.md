# ioskextdump
Dump Kext information from iOS kernel cache. Applicable to the kernel which dump from memory. The disassembly framework used is [Capstone](http://www.capstone-engine.org/)

##### 32bit version of iOS:
**32bit(arm):  [ioskextdump_32](https://github.com/cocoahuke/ioskextdump_32)**
##### 64bit version of iOS10:
**64bit(arm):  [ioskextdump_ios10](https://github.com/cocoahuke/ioskextdump_ios10)**
##### Dump Kext info For Mac:
**64bit(x86_64):  [mackextdump](https://github.com/cocoahuke/mackextdump)**

Analyze kernel extension information from iOS kernel cache with arm instructions and extract information, information including the basic IOKit classes construction parameters, inheritance relationship of the IOKit class and subclass methods override.

I finished this dirty project a year ago. Have been tested at iOS8& (64bit iOS9) kernel cache, Does not support iOS10, iOS10 Kext format has some changing, For example, sections of kernel cache is changed `__DATA -> __DATA_CONST`. I haven't studied the kernel of iOS10 yet because I spend time to learn something else

The project will begin from `__DATA.__ mod_init_func` as start point. Get all basic IOKit class construction functions first, and then export Kexts from `__PRELINK_TEXT.__text` one by one. According to basic IOKit classes’s VM address get a different inheritance relationship of IOKit classes of Kexts so this program could analyze different table and compare to its superclass, The result obtained is determine which functions this IOKit class override.
So it needs to execute twice to get the inheritance order of all classes, first time was record information

And also will determine structure of `IOExternalMethodDispatch` if its a Userclient class, but many classes implements their own externalMethod, didn’t use any `IOExternalMethodDispatch`, `IOExternalMethod` or `IOExternalTrap`
 So still need lots of manual analysis to find interface of Kext

### For kernel which dump from memory
Use [iosdumpkernelfix](https://github.com/cocoahuke/iosdumpkernelfix) to correct the Mach-O header before analyze it, Otherwise The analysis results are not complete list of Kexts

# How to use

**Download**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cocoahuke/ioskextdump.git && cd ioskextdump
```
**Compile and install** to /usr/local/bin/

```bash
make
make install
```
**Usage**
```
Usage: ioskextdump [-e] [-p <access directory path>] <kernelcache>
```
`-e` Specify the export mode  
`-p` Specifiy a folder path that contains the data file or export data file to there  
<br>  
**Example to use**
I left a sample iOS8.3 kernelcache in the test directory, try to run this command  
```
ioskextdump -e -p test test/iPhone6p_8.3_kernel.arm
```
You will see all Inheritance relationship is empty and `allClass_relation.plist saved success` should be at end of program print  
```
Inheritance relationship:
```
<br>

Then try same command removes `-e`
```
ioskextdump -p test test/iPhone6p_8.3_kernel.arm
```
ioskextdump will print contain lists of inheritance and override functions:
```
******** 3:com.apple.iokit.IOAcceleratorFamily2 *******
